1)Not Boring Movies

Write a solution to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not "boring".
Return the result table ordered by rating in descending order.
The result format is in the following example.
Example 1:
Input: 
Cinema table:
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| id | movie      | description | rating |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
| 2  | Science    | fiction     | 8.5    |
| 3  | irish      | boring      | 6.2    |
| 4  | Ice song   | Fantacy     | 8.6    |
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
Output: 
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| id | movie      | description | rating |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
Explanation: 
We have three movies with odd-numbered IDs: 1, 3, and 5. The movie with ID = 3 is boring so we do not include it in the answer.

Solution:
select * from cinema where id%2==1 and rating<>"boring" order by rating desc;

Explanation:
id%2==1 filter out odd id's and '<>' is a not equal to operator the result is then ordered by rating in descending order

2)Average Selling Price

Write a solution to find the average selling price for each product. average_price should be rounded to 2 decimal places. If a product does not have any sold units, its average selling price is assumed to be 0.
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example.
Example 1:
Input: 
Prices table:
+------------+------------+------------+--------+
| product_id | start_date | end_date   | price  |
+------------+------------+------------+--------+
| 1          | 2019-02-17 | 2019-02-28 | 5      |
| 1          | 2019-03-01 | 2019-03-22 | 20     |
| 2          | 2019-02-01 | 2019-02-20 | 15     |
| 2          | 2019-02-21 | 2019-03-31 | 30     |
+------------+------------+------------+--------+
UnitsSold table:
+------------+---------------+-------+
| product_id | purchase_date | units |
+------------+---------------+-------+
| 1          | 2019-02-25    | 100   |
| 1          | 2019-03-01    | 15    |
| 2          | 2019-02-10    | 200   |
| 2          | 2019-03-22    | 30    |
+------------+---------------+-------+
Output: 
+------------+---------------+
| product_id | average_price |
+------------+---------------+
| 1          | 6.96          |
| 2          | 16.96         |
+------------+---------------+
Explanation: 
Average selling price = Total Price of Product / Number of products sold.
Average selling price for product 1 = ((100 * 5) + (15 * 20)) / 115 = 6.96
Average selling price for product 2 = ((200 * 15) + (30 * 30)) / 230 = 16.96

Solution:
select p.product_id,coalesce(round(sum(p.price*u.units)/sum(u.units),2),0)as average_price
from prices p left join unitssold u on p.product_id=u.product_id AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date group by p.product_id;

Explanation:
This query calculates the average selling price for each product. It joins product price information with units sold data, ensuring sales are 
matched to the correct price period. The COALESCE function handles products with no sales, returning an average price of 0 in such cases. 

3)Project Employees I

Write an SQL query that reports the average experience years of all the employees for each project, rounded to 2 digits.
Return the result table in any order.
The query result format is in the following example.
Example 1:
Input: 
Project table:
+-------------+-------------+
| project_id  | employee_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 3           |
| 2           | 1           |
| 2           | 4           |
+-------------+-------------+
Employee table:
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| employee_id | name   | experience_years |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| 1           | Khaled | 3                |
| 2           | Ali    | 2                |
| 3           | John   | 1                |
| 4           | Doe    | 2                |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
Output: 
+-------------+---------------+
| project_id  | average_years |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 2.00          |
| 2           | 2.50          |
+-------------+---------------+
Explanation: The average experience years for the first project is (3 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 2.00 and for the second project is (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.50

Solution:
select p.project_id,round(avg(e.experience_years),2)as average_years from project p join employee e on p.employee_id=e.employee_id group by p.project_id;

Explanation:
This SQL query calculates the average experience years of employees for each project. It achieves this by joining the Project and
Employee tables on employee_id, then groups the results by project_id. Finally, it computes the average of experience_years for each project and rounds the result to two decimal places. 

4)Percentage of Users Attended a Contest

Write a solution to find the percentage of the users registered in each contest rounded to two decimals.
Return the result table ordered by percentage in descending order. In case of a tie, order it by contest_id in ascending order.
The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:
Input: 
Users table:
+---------+-----------+
| user_id | user_name |
+---------+-----------+
| 6       | Alice     |
| 2       | Bob       |
| 7       | Alex      |
+---------+-----------+
Register table:
+------------+---------+
| contest_id | user_id |
+------------+---------+
| 215        | 6       |
| 209        | 2       |
| 208        | 2       |
| 210        | 6       |
| 208        | 6       |
| 209        | 7       |
| 209        | 6       |
| 215        | 7       |
| 208        | 7       |
| 210        | 2       |
| 207        | 2       |
| 210        | 7       |
+------------+---------+
Output: 
+------------+------------+
| contest_id | percentage |
+------------+------------+
| 208        | 100.0      |
| 209        | 100.0      |
| 210        | 100.0      |
| 215        | 66.67      |
| 207        | 33.33      |
+------------+------------+
Explanation: 
All the users registered in contests 208, 209, and 210. The percentage is 100% and we sort them in the answer table by contest_id in ascending order.
Alice and Alex registered in contest 215 and the percentage is ((2/3) * 100) = 66.67%
Bob registered in contest 207 and the percentage is ((1/3) * 100) = 33.33%

Solution:
select r.contest_id,coalesce(round(100*count(r.user_id)/(select count(*)from users),2))as percentage from users u join register r on u.user_id=r.user_id group by r.contest_id
order by percentage desc,contest_id asc;

Explanation:
- It calculates the percentage of users registered for each contest by joining the `Users` and `Register` tables, grouping by `contest_id`, and dividing the count of registered users by the total number of users.
- The `COALESCE` ensures that if no users are registered for a contest, the percentage defaults to `0` instead of returning null, and `ROUND(...,2)` formats it to two decimal places.
- Results are sorted in descending order of registration percentage, and for ties, by ascending `contest_id`, giving a clear leaderboard of contest popularity.
